        <div class="h3">THERE ARE MAJOR RISKS IN TRADING, INVESTING, AND DAY TRADING ONLINE, WHICH MAKES IT UNSUITABLE FOR EVERYONE.</div>
        <p>I. Logging onto and using the information provided on ourPesa Financial.com or submitting an application for any of our services including but not limited to Free Trials, Subscription-Based Services, etc. (hereafter referred to as "MEMBER", "SUBSCRIBER", OR "MEMBERSHIP"), you hereby agree unconditionally to the legal terms and condition stated here.</p>
        <p>II. The website, ourPesa Financial.com, which is wholly-owned by of International Pesa Financia, Inc., is an independent website providing information for online traders, day traders, day trading "SUBSCRIBERS", momentum traders, etc., to distribute and exchange information in various forms on subjects including but not limited to FOREX, Futures, and Equities Trading.</p>
        <p>III. Information provided in any of the services provided by ourPesa Financial.com is solely for educational purposes only. As such, no legal responsibility is assumed by us, and the accuracy or reliability of information, quotes, opinions, or advice that results from any of our services is absolutely not guaranteed. Every "SUBSCRIBER" assumes sole legal responsibility for his or her decisions to follow suggestions made in any of our services to BUY or SELL Stocks, FOREX Lots, Futures, or Equities.</p>
        <p>IV. International Pesa Financia, Inc., ourPesa Financial.com, and any of our subsidiaries, do not guarantee or represent that any "SUBSCRIBER" who follow any suggestions or advice given in any of our services, will be making profits.</p>
        <p>V. International Pesa Financia, Inc., its staff, consultants, and/or outsourcers, may hold positions in multiple Stocks, FOREX Lots, Futures, or Equities, mentioned in any of the services we provide. We are not obliged in any way to reveal information about this including but not limited to the time of acquisition of Stocks, FOREX, Futures, or Equities, as well as the amount of the position held or the closing time of a position.</p>
        <p>VI. We recommend that every "SUBSCRIBER" seeks information from his or her preferred financial or investment advisor before getting into trading Stocks, FOREX, Futures, or Equities. Therefore, ourPesa Financial.com is not providing, whatsoever, any professional services, whether financial or investment, and every potential "SUBSCRIBER" is recommended to seek fundamental trading education.</p>
        <p>VII. I ("SUBSCRIBER") understand and agree that ourPesa Financial.com reserves the right to cancel my subscription at its absolute discretion, and no form of refund will be due to me for whatever reason. I also agree and understand that I reserve the right to cancel my membership by the terms stipulated in the TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS page. I agree that deciding to terminate my 'MEMBERSHIP' before the expiration date of my current subscription entitles me to no form of credits or refunds for my unused 'SUBSCRIPTION' or 'MEMBERSHIP'. I understand that in the event that I cancel my 'MEMBERSHIP' prior to my current subscription period being completed, I am not entitled to any credits or refunds for my unused 'MEMBERSHIP' or 'SUBSCRIPTION' term.</p>
        <p>VIII. In addition, ourPesa Financial.com reserves the right to approve or deny the reactivation of a canceled membership. Moreover, ourPesa Financial.com is under no legal obligation to disclose reasoning for such denials.</p>
        <p>IX. ('SUBSCRIBER' may hereinafter be referred to as 'I', 'MY', 'ME', 'YOU') I accept sole responsibility for any and all day trading, online trading, or online trading decisions, and accept that such decisions are made by ME alone. All transactions that occur in MY trading account with MY preferred broker are MY responsibility and I accept all legal responsibility for them. Heavy losses can be incurred when buying or selling FOREX, Stocks, Futures, or Equities, and YOU should carefully analyze YOUR financial condition to determine if trading FOREX, Stocks, Futures, or Equities Contracts, is financially prudent for you. I understand that buying or selling Stocks, FOREX, Futures, or Equities, can expose me to severe risks including the fact that I can suffer a loss of a percentage (if not 100%) of MY capital, cash, and/or assets pledged to trade Stocks, FOREX Lots, Futures Contracts, or Equities, through MY legal preferred broker.</p>
        <p>X. I understand that ourPesa Financial.com is not responsible in any way, whatsoever, for any trading transactions that occur in MY trading account between ME and MY preferred broker. I agree that there may be periods when the Market turns against ME, or unfavorable Market conditions arise which make it hard, if not impossible, for Me to liquidate a position, and I assume full legal responsibility should this occur. I agree that purchasing or selling Stocks, FOREX Lots, Futures, and Equities, stated in any of the services provided by ourPesa Financial.com may result in a profit or loss.</p>
        <p>XI. I understand as a trader that I am fully responsible for MY orders placed; MY orders filled; MY Stocks, FOREX Lots, Futures Contracts, or Equities, sold; MY Stocks, FOREX Lots, Futures Contracts, or Equities, bought; MY earned profits or MY incurred losses.</p>
        <p>XII. I agree and understand that while the profits of day trading Stocks, Futures, FOREX, or Equities, can be substantial, I am also exposed to the risk of heavy losses of MY cash, capital, or assets, and therefore agree not to hold International Pesa Financia, Inc., and any of its subsidiaries, responsible for any losses, no matter how large they may be. I understand that there may be other risks involved in the Buying/Selling of Stocks, FOREX, Futures, and Equities, online, not stated in this DISCLAIMER and it is my absolute legal responsibility to know, investigate, research, and assume, all additional risks inherent in trading. I also agree that the past performance of any of the services offered by ourPesa Financial.com should NOT be the basis for the expected results of MY trading.</p>
        <p>XIII. International Pesa Financia, Inc., ourPesa Financial.com, or any of its subsidiaries, will not be held responsible to 'SUBSCRIBERS', or any other parties, for incurred losses, costs or expenses, loss of use, and damages (consequential/incidental or both) resulting from mistakes in, omissions from, or changes to, information, links, downloaded material or other materials, a 'SUBSCRIBER' may receive or come into contact with, while accessing the website. We do not provide any guarantees for the accuracy or validity of the information provided in any of our services generated from generally reliable sources due to the refusal of such companies to provide legal guarantees for their information.</p>
        <p>XIV. The website, ourPesa Financial.com, does not accept any liability or legal responsibility for, arising out of use, any investment, online trades, interpretation, or acceptance, of any information available on this website. YOU agree to access this website at your own risk and we do not provide any legal warranty that information available or obtained on this website is absolutely accurate and reliable, or that accessing our servers cannot expose YOU to viruses or other forms of harm. YOU understand that you are solely responsible for damage or costs arising from damage to YOUR computer and any of its components.</p>
        <p>XV. YOU agree to refrain from copying, duplicating, and/or soliciting information, material, and other properties owned by ourPesa Financial.com, or any of the services we provide unless we grant YOU prior written approval and consent.</p>
        <p>XVI. YOU agree that the absolute risk of YOUR trading technique in the trading of Stocks, FOREX, Futures, or Equities, lies solely with you and you accept full legal responsibility for it. You reserve the right to act upon or discard recommendations made in the services we offer and should YOU decide to act upon any of them then YOUR actions are solely YOUR legal decision and International Pesa Financia, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries, will NOT be held responsible.</p>
        <p>XVII. The website, ourPesa Financial.com, advises all 'SUBSCRIBERS' to practice Demo Trading (trading accounts that do not use real cash) UNTIL you come about with a strategy that ensures consistent profit. Don't forget that real trading is substantially different from Demo trading. Demo Trading mitigates actual market conditions including, but not limited to, quick-moving markets, failure to have an order filled, bad market conditions, and so forth. An estimated 30% of your profits during demo trading should be deducted from your profits as this gives YOU a realistic view of possible earnings in actual trading. Keep in mind that there are no guarantees as to how much profits YOU will earn when trading with YOUR own money, even with the deduction of this figure. YOU are fully responsible for any risks inherent in your trades, and any online trading techniques YOU develop by using any of our services can expose you to risks.</p>
        <p>XVIII. International Pesa Financia, Inc. reserves the legal right to review and make changes to its 'MEMBERSHIP' fees at any time it deems necessary without prior notification to subscribers of such adjustments.</p>
        <p>XIV. We have a Zero Tolerance Policy for promotion of stocks, abusive language, or acts that we deem disruptive in our Live Trading Rooms or other areas of our website. And, ourPesa Financial.com reserves the right to terminate 'SUBSCRIBERS' found guilty of this policy.</p>
        <p>XV. International Pesa Financia, Inc. does not represent itself as an Investment Advisor or investing in Stocks, Futures, or Equities. We, therefore, do not provide any kind, whatsoever, of investing advice.</p>
        <div class="h2">TRADE SIGNALS SERVICE AND FOREX</div>
        <div class="h3">Risk Disclosure</div>
        <p>You should carefully think over your investment objectives, risks, and experience before participating in the Futures &amp; Forex market. It is important to not invest money you cannot afford to lose.</p>
        <p>Considerable risks in Futures &amp; Forex transactions exist. Those risks include without limitation, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection, and market volatility that may substantially affect the price, liquidity of a currency or currency pair, or Futures Contract.</p>
        <p>As a result of the volatile nature of Futures &amp; Forex trading, any market movement will have an equal effect on your deposited funds. There is a possibility that you could sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and be required to deposit extra funds to maintain your position. If you fail to satisfy any margin requirement, your position may be liquidated and you become responsible for any losses. To manage exposure, employ different risk-reducing strategies.</p>
        <p>You also can face different risks associated with using an Internet-based trading system including, without limitation, the hardware, software, and Internet connection failures. International Pesa Financia is not responsible for any communication failures or delays when trading via the Internet.</p>
        <p>International Pesa Financia is not liable for any loss or damage, including without limitation, any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from use of or reliance on systems and signals provided by services of International Pesa Financia. International Pesa Financia is not responsible for the correctness of any signals and systems available through International Pesa Financia.</p>
        <p>Any opinions, news, research, analyses, prices, or other information offered by International Pesa Financia does not constitute investment advice. International Pesa Financia will not accept liability for any loss or damage, including without limitation to, any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from use of or reliance on such information.</p>

        <p>Independent Affiliates are Independent Contractors responsible for determining their own activities without direction or control by Company. They are not franchisees, joint ventures, partners, employees, or agents of Company and are prohibited from stating or implying, whether orally or in writing, otherwise. Independent Affiliates have no authority to bind the Company to any obligation. The company is not responsible for the pay&shy;ment or co-payment of any employee benefits.

        <div class="h2">SECTION TWO: TERM &amp; RENEWAL</div>
        <div class="h3">2.01 TERM</div>

        <p>Independent Affiliates must renew annually, on the Anniversary Date and Independent Affiliate has the right to decline to accept any renewal at its sole discretion. Company may require that Independent Affiliates execute a new Agreement upon renewal.

Independent Affiliates who fail to renew their Independent Affiliate sta&shy;tus may not reapply under a new sponsor for three (3) months after non-renewal.</p>

        <div class="h3">3.05 TRANSFER OF SPONSORSHIP</div>

Once an Independent Affiliate is sponsored, the company believes in maximum protection of that relationship. The only exception is upon prior written ap&shy;proval of the Company to correct ethical violations as determined at the sole discre&shy;tion of Company.</p>
        <div class="h3">3.06 CROSS SPONSORING</div>
        <p>Independent Affiliate may not sponsor, or attempt to sponsor, any non personally sponsored Independent Affiliates in any other Network Marketing Company.

        <div class="h3">4.01 VOLUNTARY RESIGNATION</div>

        <p>b) Independent Affiliate who resigns or terminates their Independent Affiliate status may reapply as Independent Affiliate, three (3) months after resignation.</p>
        <div class="h3">4.02 SUSPENSION</div>
        <p>Independent Sales Representative may be suspended for violating the terms of his or her Agree&shy;ment, which includes these Policies and Procedures, the Terms and Conditions and the Compensation Plan, and other documents produced by Company. When a decision is made to sus&shy;pend Independent Sales Representative, Company will inform the Independent Sales Representative in writing that the sus&shy;pension has occurred effective as of the date of the written notification, the reason for the suspension, and the steps necessary to remove such suspen&shy;sion (if any). The suspension notice will be sent to the Independent Sales Representatives "address on file" pursuant to the notice provisions contained in the Policies and Procedures and Terms and Conditions. Such suspension may or may not lead to termination of the Independent Sales Representative as so determined by Company at its sole discretion. If the Independent Sales Representative wishes to appeal, Company must receive such appeal in writing within fifteen (15) days from the date of the suspension notice. The company will re&shy;view and consider the suspension and notify the Independent Sales Representative in writing of its decision within thirty (30) days from the date of the suspension notice. The decision of the Company will be final and subject to no further review. Company may take certain action during the suspension period, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p>a) Prohibiting the Independent Sales Representative from holding himself or herself as an Independent Sales Representative or using any of Company's proprietary marks and/or materials;</p>
        <p>b) Withholding commissions and bonuses that are due to the Independent Sales Representative during the suspension period;</p>
        <p>c) Prohibiting the Independent Sales Representative from purchasing services and products from Company; and/or;</p>
