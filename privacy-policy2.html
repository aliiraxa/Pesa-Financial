                      cause a promotion off a direct or indirect IBO in their sales and marketing organization
                      in an unearned manner. One example of stacking occurs when a Sponsor places IBO(s) under
                      an inactive IBO lower in the compensation tree without his or her knowledge in order to
                      trigger unearned qualification for commissioning purposes. Stacking is unethical and
                      unacceptable behavior, and as such, it is a punishable offense with measures up to and
                      including the termination of the independent IBO positions of all individuals and/or
                      entities found to be directly involved.

                      other direct sales company. If any lawsuit, arbitration, or mediation is brought against
                      an IBO alleging that they engaged in inappropriate sponsoring/recruiting activity of

                      their insurance agent to make certain their business property is protected. In most
                      instances, this may be accomplished with a &#8220;Business Pursuit&#8221; endorsement to an existing

                      that the unintentional action of calling someone whose telephone number is listed on the
